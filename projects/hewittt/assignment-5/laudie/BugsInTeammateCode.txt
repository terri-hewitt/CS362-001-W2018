Bug Report:

Bug #1: Located in Appt.java in isValid() function line 115. The condition to check if
	the start hour is valid checks if the start hour is less than 0 AND greater 
	than 23. This means that the condition will always be false so it will
	never enter that if statement, which means any start hour will be considered
	valid.

Bug #2: Located in Appt.java in isValid() function line 124. The condition to check if
	the start month is valid checks is the start month is between 1 and 12. This 
	will cause an error if the start month is 12 because the array for the number of
	days in each month only has 12 elements, meaning that trying to get a number of days 
	at index [12] will go off the end of the array. This bug also causes the number of
	days in each month to be incorrect, which explains why when I set the date of an
	appointment to 1/31/xx, I received an error that the appointment was invalid.

Bug #3: Located in TimeTable.java in getApptRange() function line 63. DaysDifference is
	initially set to 1 when it should be 0. This causes the difference between two
	dates to always be 1 more than it actually is, so when calDays.get(daysDifference)
	is called, it will always index off of the end of the calDays array.
